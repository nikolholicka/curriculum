All haile Macbeth, that shalt be King hereafter\\n\\n   Banq. Good Sir, why doe you start, and seeme to feare\\nThings that doe sound so faire? i'th' name of truth\\nAre ye fantasticall, or that indeed\\nWhich outwardly ye shew? My Noble Partner\\nYou greet with present Grace, and great prediction\\nOf Noble hauing, and of Royall hope,\\nThat he seemes wrapt withall: to me you speake not.\\nIf you can looke into the Seedes of Time,\\nAnd say, which Graine will grow, and which will not,\\nSpeake then to me, who neyther begge, nor feare\\nYour fauors, nor your hate\\n\\n   1.

Say from whence\\nYou owe this strange Intelligence, or why\\nVpon this blasted Heath you stop our way\\nWith such Prophetique greeting?\\nSpeake, I charge you.\\n\\nWitches vanish.\\n\\n  Banq. The Earth hath bubbles, as the Water ha's,\\nAnd these are of them: whither are they vanish'd?\\n  Macb. Into the Ayre: and what seem'd corporall,\\nMelted, as breath into the Winde.\\nWould they had stay'd\\n\\n   Banq.

What, can the Deuill speake true?\\n  Macb. The Thane of Cawdor liues:\\nWhy doe you dresse me in borrowed Robes?\\n  Ang. Who was the Thane, liues yet,\\nBut vnder heauie Iudgement beares that Life,\\nWhich he deserues to loose.\\nWhether he was combin'd with those of Norway,\\nOr did lyne the Rebell with hidden helpe,\\nAnd vantage; or that with both he labour'd\\nIn his Countreyes wracke, I know not:\\nBut Treasons Capitall, confess'd, and prou'd,\\nHaue ouerthrowne him\\n\\n   Macb. Glamys, and Thane of Cawdor:\\nThe greatest is behinde. Thankes for your paines.\\nDoe you not hope your Children shall be Kings,\\nWhen those that gaue the Thane of Cawdor to me,\\nPromis'd no lesse to them\\n\\n   Banq. That trusted home,\\nMight yet enkindle you vnto the Crowne,\\nBesides the Thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange:\\nAnd oftentimes, to winne vs to our harme,\\nThe Instruments of Darknesse tell vs Truths,\\nWinne vs with honest Trifles, to betray's\\nIn deepest consequence.\\nCousins, a word, I pray you\\n\\n   Macb. Two Truths are told,\\nAs happy Prologues to the swelling Act\\nOf the Imperiall Theame. I thanke you Gentlemen:\\nThis supernaturall solliciting\\nCannot be ill; cannot be good.\\nIf ill? why hath it giuen me earnest of successe,\\nCommencing in a Truth? I am Thane of Cawdor.\\nIf good? why doe I yeeld to that suggestion,\\nWhose horrid Image doth vnfixe my Heire,\\nAnd make my seated Heart knock at my Ribbes,\\nAgainst the vse of Nature? Present Feares\\nAre lesse then horrible Imaginings:\\nMy Thought, whose Murther yet is but fantasticall,\\nShakes so my single state of Man,\\nThat Function is smother'd in surmise,\\nAnd nothing is, but what is not\\n\\n   Banq. Looke how our Partner's rapt\\n\\n   Macb. If Chance will haue me King,\\nWhy Chance may Crowne me,\\nWithout my stirre\\n\\n   Banq. New Honors come vpon him\\nLike our strange Garments, cleaue not to their mould,\\nBut with the aid of vse\\n\\n   Macb. Come what come may,\\nTime, and the Houre, runs through the roughest Day\\n\\n   Banq. Worthy Macbeth, wee stay vpon your leysure\\n\\n   Macb. Giue me your fauour:\\nMy dull Braine was wrought with things forgotten.\\nKinde Gentlemen, your paines are registred,\\nWhere euery day I turne the Leafe,\\nTo reade them.\\nLet vs toward the King: thinke vpon\\nWhat hath chanc'd: and at more time,\\nThe Interim hauing weigh'd it, let vs speake\\nOur free Hearts each to other\\n\\n   Banq.

Is execution done on Cawdor?\\nOr not those in Commission yet return'd?\\n  Mal. My Liege, they are not yet come back.\\nBut I haue spoke with one that saw him die:\\nWho did report, that very frankly hee\\nConfess'd his Treasons, implor'd your Highnesse Pardon,\\nAnd set forth a deepe Repentance:\\nNothing in his Life became him,\\nLike the leauing it. Hee dy'de,\\nAs one that had beene studied in his death,\\nTo throw away the dearest thing he ow'd,\\nAs 'twere a carelesse Trifle\\n\\n   King.

Thou art too like the Spirit of Banquo: Down:\\nThy Crowne do's seare mine Eye-bals. And thy haire\\nThou other Gold-bound-brow, is like the first:\\nA third, is like the former. Filthy Hagges,\\nWhy do you shew me this? - A fourth? Start eyes!\\nWhat will the Line stretch out to'th' cracke of Doome?\\nAnother yet? A seauenth? Ile see no more:\\nAnd yet the eighth appeares, who beares a glasse,\\nWhich shewes me many more: and some I see,\\nThat two-fold Balles, and trebble Scepters carry.\\nHorrible sight: Now I see 'tis true,\\nFor the Blood-bolter'd Banquo smiles vpon me,\\nAnd points at them for his. What? is this so?\\n  1 I Sir, all this is so. But why\\nStands Macbeth thus amazedly?\\nCome Sisters, cheere we vp his sprights,\\nAnd shew the best of our delights.\\nIle Charme the Ayre to giue a sound,\\nWhile you performe your Antique round:\\nThat this great King may kindly say,\\nOur duties, did his welcome pay.\\n\\nMusicke.

From this moment,\\nThe very firstlings of my heart shall be\\nThe firstlings of my hand. And euen now\\nTo Crown my thoughts with Acts: be it thoght & done:\\nThe Castle of Macduff, I will surprize.\\nSeize vpon Fife; giue to th' edge o'th' Sword\\nHis Wife, his Babes, and all vnfortunate Soules\\nThat trace him in his Line. No boasting like a Foole,\\nThis deed Ile do, before this purpose coole,\\nBut no more sights. Where are these Gentlemen?\\nCome bring me where they are.\\n\\nExeunt.\\n\\nScena Secunda.\\n\\nEnter Macduffes Wife, her Son, and Rosse.\\n\\n  Wife. What had he done, to make him fly the Land?\\n  Rosse. You must haue patience Madam\\n\\n   Wife. He had none:\\nHis flight was madnesse: when our Actions do not,\\nOur feares do make vs Traitors\\n\\n   Rosse. You know not\\nWhether it was his wisedome, or his feare\\n\\n   Wife. Wisedom? to leaue his wife, to leaue his Babes,\\nHis Mansion, and his Titles, in a place\\nFrom whence himselfe do's flye? He loues vs not,\\nHe wants the naturall touch. For the poore Wren\\n(The most diminitiue of Birds) will fight,\\nHer yong ones in her Nest, against the Owle:\\nAll is the Feare, and nothing is the Loue;\\nAs little is the Wisedome, where the flight\\nSo runnes against all reason\\n\\n   Rosse. My deerest Cooz,\\nI pray you schoole your selfe. But for your Husband,\\nHe is Noble, Wise, Iudicious, and best knowes\\nThe fits o'th' Season. I dare not speake much further,\\nBut cruell are the times, when we are Traitors\\nAnd do not know our selues: when we hold Rumor\\nFrom what we feare, yet know not what we feare,\\nBut floate vpon a wilde and violent Sea\\nEach way, and moue. I take my leaue of you:\\nShall not be long but Ile be heere againe:\\nThings at the worst will cease, or else climbe vpward,\\nTo what they were before.

With what I get I meane, and so do they\\n\\n   Wife. Poore Bird,\\nThou'dst neuer Feare the Net, nor Lime,\\nThe Pitfall, nor the Gin\\n\\n   Son.

Nay how will you do for a Husband?\\n  Wife. Why I can buy me twenty at any Market\\n\\n   Son. Then you'l by 'em to sell againe\\n\\n   Wife. Thou speak'st withall thy wit,\\nAnd yet I'faith with wit enough for thee\\n\\n   Son. Was my Father a Traitor, Mother?\\n  Wife. I, that he was\\n\\n   Son. What is a Traitor?\\n  Wife. Why one that sweares, and lyes\\n\\n   Son. And be all Traitors, that do so\\n\\n   Wife. Euery one that do's so, is a Traitor,\\nAnd must be hang'd\\n\\n   Son. And must they all be hang'd, that swear and lye?\\n  Wife. Euery one\\n\\n   Son. Who must hang them?\\n  Wife. Why, the honest men\\n\\n   Son. Then the Liars and Swearers are Fools: for there\\nare Lyars and Swearers enow, to beate the honest men,\\nand hang vp them\\n\\n   Wife. Now God helpe thee, poore Monkie:\\nBut how wilt thou do for a Father?\\n  Son. If he were dead, youl'd weepe for him: if you\\nwould not, it were a good signe, that I should quickely\\nhaue a new Father\\n\\n   Wife. Poore pratler, how thou talk'st?\\nEnter a Messenger.\\n\\n  Mes. Blesse you faire Dame: I am not to you known,\\nThough in your state of Honor I am perfect;\\nI doubt some danger do's approach you neerely.\\nIf you will take a homely mans aduice,\\nBe not found heere: Hence with your little ones\\nTo fright you thus. Me thinkes I am too sauage:\\nTo do worse to you, were fell Cruelty,\\nWhich is too nie your person. Heauen preserue you,\\nI dare abide no longer.\\n\\nExit Messenger\\n\\n  Wife. Whether should I flye?\\nI haue done no harme. But I remember now\\nI am in this earthly world: where to do harme\\nIs often laudable, to do good sometime\\nAccounted dangerous folly. Why then (alas)\\nDo I put vp that womanly defence,\\nTo say I haue done no harme?\\nWhat are these faces?\\nEnter Murtherers.\\n\\n  Mur. Where is your Husband?\\n  Wife. I hope in no place so vnsanctified,\\nWhere such as thou may'st finde him\\n\\n   Mur. He's a Traitor\\n\\n   Son. Thou ly'st thou shagge-ear'd Villaine\\n\\n   Mur. What you Egge?\\nYong fry of Treachery?\\n  Son. He ha's kill'd me Mother,\\nRun away I pray you.\\n\\nExit crying Murther.\\n\\n\\nScaena Tertia.\\n\\nEnter Malcolme and Macduffe.\\n\\n  Mal. Let vs seeke out some desolate shade, & there\\nWeepe our sad bosomes empty\\n\\n   Macd. Let vs rather\\nHold fast the mortall Sword: and like good men,\\nBestride our downfall Birthdome: each new Morne,\\nNew Widdowes howle, new Orphans cry, new sorowes\\nStrike heauen on the face, that it resounds\\nAs if it felt with Scotland, and yell'd out\\nLike Syllable of Dolour\\n\\n   Mal. What I beleeue, Ile waile;\\nWhat know, beleeue; and what I can redresse,\\nAs I shall finde the time to friend: I wil.\\nWhat you haue spoke, it may be so perchance.\\nThis Tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,\\nWas once thought honest: you haue lou'd him well,\\nHe hath not touch'd you yet. I am yong, but something\\nYou may discerne of him through me, and wisedome\\nTo offer vp a weake, poore innocent Lambe\\nT' appease an angry God\\n\\n   Macd. I am not treacherous\\n\\n   Malc. But Macbeth is.\\nA good and vertuous Nature may recoyle\\nIn an Imperiall charge. But I shall craue your pardon:\\nThat which you are, my thoughts cannot transpose;\\nAngels are bright still, though the brightest fell.\\nThough all things foule, would wear the brows of grace\\nYet Grace must still looke so\\n\\n   Macd. I haue lost my Hopes\\n\\n   Malc. Perchance euen there\\nWhere I did finde my doubts.\\nWhy in that rawnesse left you Wife, and Childe?\\nThose precious Motiues, those strong knots of Loue,\\nWithout leaue-taking. I pray you,\\nLet not my Iealousies, be your Dishonors,\\nBut mine owne Safeties: you may be rightly iust,\\nWhat euer I shall thinke\\n\\n   Macd. Bleed, bleed poore Country,\\nGreat Tyrrany, lay thou thy basis sure,\\nFor goodnesse dare not check thee: wear y thy wrongs,\\nThe Title, is affear'd. Far thee well Lord,\\nI would not be the Villaine that thou think'st,\\nFor the whole Space that's in the Tyrants Graspe,\\nAnd the rich East to boot\\n\\n   Mal. Be not offended:\\nI speake not as in absolute feare of you:\\nI thinke our Country sinkes beneath the yoake,\\nIt weepes, it bleeds, and each new day a gash\\nIs added to her wounds. I thinke withall,\\nThere would be hands vplifted in my right:\\nAnd heere from gracious England haue I offer\\nOf goodly thousands. But for all this,\\nWhen I shall treade vpon the Tyrants head,\\nOr weare it on my Sword; yet my poore Country\\nShall haue more vices then it had before,\\nMore suffer, and more sundry wayes then euer,\\nBy him that shall succeede\\n\\n   Macd. What should he be?\\n  Mal. It is my selfe I meane: in whom I know\\nAll the particulars of Vice so grafted,\\nThat when they shall be open'd, blacke Macbeth\\nWill seeme as pure as Snow, and the poore State\\nEsteeme him as a Lambe, being compar'd\\nWith my confinelesse harmes\\n\\n   Macd. Not in the Legions\\nOf horrid Hell, can come a Diuell more damn'd\\nIn euils, to top Macbeth\\n\\n   Mal. I grant him Bloody,\\nLuxurious, Auaricious, False, Deceitfull,\\nSodaine, Malicious, smacking of euery sinne\\nThat ha's a name. But there's no bottome, none\\nIn my Voluptuousnesse: Your Wiues, your Daughters,\\nYour Matrons, and your Maides, could not fill vp\\nThe Cesterne of my Lust, and my Desire\\nAll continent Impediments would ore-beare\\nThat did oppose my will. Better Macbeth,\\nThen such an one to reigne\\n\\n   Macd. Boundlesse intemperance\\nIn Nature is a Tyranny: It hath beene\\nTh' vntimely emptying of the happy Throne,\\nAnd fall of many Kings. But feare not yet\\nTo take vpon you what is yours: you may\\nConuey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,\\nAnd yet seeme cold. The time you may so hoodwinke:\\nWe haue willing Dames enough: there cannot be\\nThat Vulture in you, to deuoure so many\\nAs will to Greatnesse dedicate themselues,\\nFinding it so inclinde\\n\\n   Mal. With this, there growes\\nIn my most ill-composd Affection, such\\nA stanchlesse Auarice, that were I King,\\nI should cut off the Nobles for their Lands,\\nDesire his Iewels, and this others House,\\nAnd my more-hauing, would be as a Sawce\\nTo make me hunger more, that I should forge\\nQuarrels vniust against the Good and Loyall,\\nDestroying them for wealth\\n\\n   Macd. This Auarice\\nstickes deeper: growes with more pernicious roote\\nThen Summer-seeming Lust: and it hath bin\\nThe Sword of our slaine Kings: yet do not feare,\\nScotland hath Foysons, to fill vp your will\\nOf your meere Owne. All these are portable,\\nWith other Graces weigh'd\\n\\n   Mal. But I haue none. The King-becoming Graces,\\nAs Iustice, Verity, Temp'rance, Stablenesse,\\nBounty, Perseuerance, Mercy, Lowlinesse,\\nDeuotion, Patience, Courage, Fortitude,\\nI haue no rellish of them, but abound\\nIn the diuision of each seuerall Crime,\\nActing it many wayes. Nay, had I powre, I should\\nPoure the sweet Milke of Concord, into Hell,\\nVprore the vniuersall peace, confound\\nAll vnity on earth\\n\\n   Macd. O Scotland, Scotland\\n\\n   Mal. If such a one be fit to gouerne, speake:\\nI am as I haue spoken\\n\\n   Mac. Fit to gouern? No not to liue. O Natio[n] miserable!\\nWith an vntitled Tyrant, bloody Sceptred,\\nWhen shalt thou see thy wholsome dayes againe?\\nSince that the truest Issue of thy Throne\\nBy his owne Interdiction stands accust,\\nAnd do's blaspheme his breed? Thy Royall Father\\nWas a most Sainted-King: the Queene that bore thee,\\nOftner vpon her knees, then on her feet,\\nDy'de euery day she liu'd. Fare thee well,\\nThese Euils thou repeat'st vpon thy selfe,\\nHath banish'd me from Scotland. O my Brest,\\nThy hope ends heere\\n\\n   Mal. Macduff, this Noble passion\\nChilde of integrity, hath from my soule\\nWip'd the blacke Scruples, reconcil'd my thoughts\\nTo thy good Truth, and Honor. Diuellish Macbeth,\\nBy many of these traines, hath sought to win me\\nInto his power: and modest Wisedome pluckes me\\nFrom ouer-credulous hast: but God aboue\\nDeale betweene thee and me; For euen now\\nI put my selfe to thy Direction, and\\nVnspeake mine owne detraction. Heere abiure\\nThe taints, and blames I laide vpon my selfe,\\nFor strangers to my Nature. I am yet\\nVnknowne to Woman, neuer was forsworne,\\nScarsely haue coueted what was mine owne.\\nAt no time broke my Faith, would not betray\\nThe Deuill to his Fellow, and delight\\nNo lesse in truth then life. My first false speaking\\nWas this vpon my selfe. What I am truly\\nIs thine, and my poore Countries to command:\\nWhither indeed, before they heere approach\\nOld Seyward with ten thousand warlike men\\nAlready at a point, was setting foorth:\\nNow wee'l together, and the chance of goodnesse\\nBe like our warranted Quarrell. Why are you silent?\\n  Macd. Such welcome, and vnwelcom things at once\\n'Tis hard to reconcile.\\nEnter a Doctor.\\n\\n  Mal. Well, more anon. Comes the King forth\\nI pray you?\\n  Doct.

With this strange vertue,\\nHe hath a heauenly guift of Prophesie,\\nAnd sundry Blessings hang about his Throne,\\nThat speake him full of Grace.\\nEnter Rosse.\\n\\n  Macd. See who comes heere\\n\\n   Malc. My Countryman: but yet I know him not\\n\\n   Macd. My euer gentle Cozen, welcome hither\\n\\n   Malc. I know him now. Good God betimes remoue\\nThe meanes that makes vs Strangers\\n\\n   Rosse. Sir, Amen\\n\\n   Macd. Stands Scotland where it did?\\n  Rosse. Alas poore Countrey,\\nAlmost affraid to know it selfe. It cannot\\nBe call'd our Mother, but our Graue; where nothing\\nBut who knowes nothing, is once seene to smile:\\nWhere sighes, and groanes, and shrieks that rent the ayre\\nAre made, not mark'd: Where violent sorrow seemes\\nA Moderne extasie: The Deadmans knell,\\nIs there scarse ask'd for who, and good mens liues\\nExpire before the Flowers in their Caps,\\nDying, or ere they sicken\\n\\n   Macd. Oh Relation; too nice, and yet too true\\n\\n   Malc. What's the newest griefe?\\n  Rosse. That of an houres age, doth hisse the speaker,\\nEach minute teemes a new one\\n\\n   Macd.

No, they were wel at peace, when I did leaue 'em\\n  Macd. Be not a niggard of your speech: How gos't?\\n  Rosse. When I came hither to transport the Tydings\\nWhich I haue heauily borne, there ran a Rumour\\nOf many worthy Fellowes, that were out,\\nWhich was to my beleefe witnest the rather,\\nFor that I saw the Tyrants Power a-foot.\\nNow is the time of helpe: your eye in Scotland\\nWould create Soldiours, make our women fight,\\nTo doffe their dire distresses\\n\\n   Malc. Bee't their comfort\\nWe are comming thither: Gracious England hath\\nLent vs good Seyward, and ten thousand men,\\nAn older, and a better Souldier, none\\nThat Christendome giues out\\n\\n   Rosse. Would I could answer\\nThis comfort with the like. But I haue words\\nThat would be howl'd out in the desert ayre,\\nWhere hearing should not latch them\\n\\n   Macd. What concerne they,\\nThe generall cause, or is it a Fee-griefe\\nDue to some single brest?\\n  Rosse. No minde that's honest\\nBut in it shares some woe, though the maine part\\nPertaines to you alone\\n\\n   Macd. If it be mine\\nKeepe it not from me, quickly let me haue it\\n\\n   Rosse. Let not your eares dispise my tongue for euer,\\nWhich shall possesse them with the heauiest sound\\nthat euer yet they heard\\n\\n   Macd. Humh: I guesse at it\\n\\n   Rosse. Your Castle is surpriz'd: your Wife, and Babes\\nSauagely slaughter'd: To relate the manner\\nWere on the Quarry of these murther'd Deere\\nTo adde the death of you\\n\\n   Malc. Mercifull Heauen:\\nWhat man, ne're pull your hat vpon your browes:\\nGiue sorrow words; the griefe that do's not speake,\\nWhispers the o're-fraught heart, and bids it breake\\n\\n   Macd.

    "Now that we've worked through generating some baseline corpus statistics for one corpus, it's up to you to select a second corpus and generate your own corpus statistics, and then compare and contrast the two. For simplicity's sake, we recommend you stick to a corpus from `nltk.corpus.gutenberg` -- although comparing the diction found in a classic work of fiction to something like a presidential State of the Union address could be interesting, it's not really an apples-to-apples comparison, and those corpora could also require additional preprocessing steps that are outside the scope of this lab. \n",

Was there anything interesting or surprising that you found in your comparison? Create at least one meaningful visualization comparing the two corpora "
