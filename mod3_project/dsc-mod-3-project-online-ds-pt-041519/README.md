# Module 3 -  Final Project Specifications

## Introduction

In this lesson, we'll review all the guidelines and specifications for the final project for Module 3.

## Objectives

* Understand all required aspects of the Final Project for Module 3
* Understand all required deliverables
* Understand what constitutes a successful project

### Final Project Summary

Another module down--you're half way there!

For the culmination of Module 3, you just need to complete the final project!

### The Project

For this project, you'll be working with the Northwind database--a free, open-source dataset created by Microsoft containing data from a fictional company. You probably remember the Northwind database from our section on Advanced SQL. Here's the schema for the Northwind database:

The goal of this project is to test your ability to gather information from a real-world database and use your knowledge of statistical analysis and hypothesis testing to generate analytical insights that can be of value to the company.

## The Deliverables

The goal of your project is to query the database to get the data needed to perform a statistical analysis.  In this statistical analysis, you'll need to perform a hypothesis test (or perhaps several) to answer the following question:

**_Does discount amount have a statistically significant effect on the quantity of a product in an order? If so, at what level(s) of discount?_**

In addition to answering this question with a hypothesis test, you will also need to come up with **_at least 3 other hypotheses to test on your own_**.  These can by anything that you think could be imporant information for the company.

For this hypothesis, be sure to specify both the **_null hypothesis_** and the **_alternative hypothesis_** for your question.  You should also specify if this is one-tail or a two-tail test.

To complete this project, you will need to turn in the following 3 deliverables:

1. A **_Jupyter Notebook_** containing any code you've written for this project.
2. A **_[Blog Post](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-welcome-blogging)_**.
3. An **_"Executive Summary" PowerPoint Presentation_** that explains the hypothesis tests you ran, your findings, and their relevance to company stakeholders.  

### Jupyter Notebook Must-Haves

For this project, your jupyter notebook should meet the following specifications:

**_Organization/Code Cleanliness_**

* The notebook should be well organized, easy to follow, and code is commented where appropriate.  
<br>  
    * Level Up: The notebook contains well-formatted, professional looking markdown cells explaining any substantial code. All functions have docstrings that act as professional-quality documentation.  
<br>      
* The notebook is written to technical audiences with a way to both understand your approach and reproduce your results. The target audience for this deliverable is other data scientists looking to validate your findings.  
<br>    
* Any SQL code written to source data should also be included.  

**_Findings_**

* Your notebook should clearly show how you arrived at your results for each hypothesis test, including how you calculated your p-values.   
<br>
* You should also include any other statistics that you find relevant to your analysis, such as effect size.

### Blog Post Must-Haves

Refer back to the [Blogging Guidelines](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-welcome-blogging) for the technical requirements and blog ideas.


### Executive Summary Must-Haves

Your presentation should:

* Contain between 5-10 professional quality slides detailing:
<br>  
    * A high-level overview of your methodology  
    <br>  
    * The results of your hypothesis tests  
    <br>  
    * Any real-world recommendations you would like to make based on your findings (ask yourself--why should the executive team care about what you found? How can your findings help the company?)  
    <br>  
* Take no more than 5 minutes to present  
<br>  
* Avoid technical jargon and explain results in a clear, actionable way for non-technical audiences.
