We've seen instance objects, instance variables, and instance methods and how these things all work with each other. In this lab, we will talk about what a **domain model** is and how it ties into object oriented programming."

    "A domain model is the representation of a real-world concept or structure translated in to software. This is a key function of object orientation. So far, our Python classes have been used as blueprints or templates for  instance objects of that class. As an example, a Driver class would create driver instance objects, and the class would define a basic structure for what that driver instance object should look like and what capabilities it should have. But a class is only one part of a domain model just as, typically, a driver is only one part of a larger structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "A domain model is meant to mirror that larger, real-world structure. It is more than just one class, it is an entire environment that often depends on other parts or classes to function properly. So, in keeping with a Driver class, we could use the example of a taxi and limousine service as our domain model. There are many more parts to a service like this than drivers alone. We could imagine dispatchers, mechanics, accountants, passengers, etc., all being part of the structure of this domain model. In a simplified example, we could have instance and class methods handle things like `dispatch_driver`, `calculate_revenue_from_rides`, `service_taxi`, or any other function of a taxi and limousine service.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we become more fluent in object oriented programming and our programs become more complex, we will see that the other parts of a domain model like passengers, dispatchers, etc., will be classes of their own which interact with each other. \n",
